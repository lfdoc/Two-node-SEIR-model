# Two-node-SEIR-model
The two-node SEIR model based on MATLAB R2020a is used to simulate the outbreak of epidemic. R is used to calculate the correlation coefficient of different variables because some data cannot be analyzed by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The 3D scatter point plots are drawn by R. The 3D fitting surface are plotted using the griddata function of MATLAB.
