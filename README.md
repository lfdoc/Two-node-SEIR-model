# Two-node-SEIR-model
The two-node SEIR model based on MATLAB R2020a is used to simulate the outbreak of epidemic. R is used to calculate the correlation coefficient of different variables. The 3D scatter point plots are drawn by R. The 3D fitting surface are plotted using the griddata function of MATLAB.
